# BDD in Golang: An Introduction to Ginkgo & Gomega

This repository contains all the code for The Engineering Coach YouTube video, "BDD in Golang: An Introduction to Ginkgo & Gomega".

In this video, we explore a different, but complementary, approach to testing: Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD). This project serves as a practical demonstration of how to test-drive a Set abstract data type using Ginkgo and its assertion library, Gomega.

## What You'll Learn
  - The core concept of BDD and how it differs from traditional TDD.
  - How to use Ginkgo to write clear, human-readable specifications for your code.
  - How Gomega helps you write expressive and readable assertions.
  - Why BDD is a powerful tool for collaboration and documentation.

## Watch the Video Tutorial

This video is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to explore new testing philosophies and improve the way they design their code.
